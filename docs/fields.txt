Fields to export
================

It doesn't really matter how staff enter course registrations into the system,
as currently they just fill things in to the Schoolsbuddy web interface. We
could do better by simply allowing them to upload a CSV/Excel file (or offering
a Web interface if really needed).

However, it does matter how we format the information going out of the system,
as that needs to be imported into PowerSchool. The sample provided by the CCA
department includes the following needed fields (the others are not needed):

    Student Last Name (e.g. "YU")
    Student First Name (e.g. "Runxi (Runxi 于润熙)")
    SIS/MIS ID2 (the student number without a preceding "s")
    Grade/Year (a two-digit integer)
    Group/Activity (a string ending in " (SJ-Sn)" where n is the season number)
    Day ("Mon" or "Tue")
    Container (such as "SJ Season 1 2024-2025 CCA3 & CCA4")

It shall be noted that the first and last name in PowerSchool format cannot be
easily obtained from the Microsoft Graph interface. I suspect that a Microsoft
Active Directory name such as "Runxi Yu 于润熙" would also work, but I could
also work with a separate student database table.
